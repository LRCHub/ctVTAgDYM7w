```
Well, well, I said we're traveling at the speed of a reborn man
We got a lot of love to give, you better come on if you can

Gonna talk about love, don't try to run away
Check yourself out, baby, and then come with me today
Good lovin' over here, hey

Here comes a woman wrapped up in chain
You fooling with that fool, baby, putting your life in pain
If you wanna be free, come on along with me
And leave the hard-headed man, he'll never understand
I said find yourself first and then your talent
Work hard on your mind for it to come alive
Then prove to the land you understand
The eyes of God are watching you

Everybody live a lie, everybody love a lie
Everybody hear the man, hear him, hear my message
Oh, Lord, oh, oh, Lord, ooh, hey
Yeah, yeah, hey, come on, baby
Come on, come on, vibe with me, baby
